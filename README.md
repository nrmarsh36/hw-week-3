For this assignment, I used several references cited in my code as comments (

These videos helped me set up the framework for the code. 

I am still having issues with having more than two password conditions being active at a time, but I am continuing to work through that and hope to have that issue resolved soon. I attempted the split function in order to get the user input for passType to use more than one attribute for the generated password.
